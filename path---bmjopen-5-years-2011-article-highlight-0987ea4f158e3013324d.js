By reviewing the literature, Bruno da Costa and colleagues highlight how correctly to use reporting guidelines and how the guidelines are often misused to assess methodological quality rather than the quality of the reporting.</p>\n<p>So what might explain the misuse of the guidelines? According to da Costa et al.,</p>\n<p>&#8220;The misuse of STROBE as a tool to assess methodological quality may be explained by the lack of validated and accepted tools for such assessments. As a consequence, authors who want to assess methodological quality of studies may turn to reporting guidelines.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While the message is simple, it is also important, and we believe the article deserves its place as one of the journal&#8217;s highlights. It was also the first among many articles that we have published relating to <a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/collections/bmj_open_medical_publishing_and_peer_review">medical publishing and peer review</a>.<!--TrendMD v2.4.3--></p>\n'},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},pathContext:{id:"384c6266-21cf-5d62-9847-ea990d4d1540"}}}});
