New entries include Thienpont <em>et al</em>&#8216;s paper on euthanasia requests among psychiatric patients and Elwyn <em>et al</em>&#8216;s paper on the motivations of patients to record their clinical encounters, measured by a mixed-methods analysis of survey data. A Mendelian randomisation meta-analysis from Morris <em>et al</em> aimed to investigate whether heavier smoking is associated with abdominal adiposity phenotypes, concluding that smoking in an effort to control weight may lead to accumulation of central adiposity. Rao <em>et al</em>&#8216;s paper on exploring the relationship between alcohol consumption, health, ethnicity and socioeconomic deprivation was also popular this month.</p>\n<table border="1" width="483" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td valign="top" width="50">Rank</td>\n<td valign="top" width="132">Author(s)</td>\n<td valign="top" width="301">Title</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="50">1</td>\n<td width="132">Thienpont <em>et al.</em></td>\n<td valign="top" width="301"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/7/e007454.full?sid=62e3632e-2131-4a56-81ea-7d67ffe7c5b4">Euthanasia requests, procedures and outcomes for 100 Belgian patients suffering from psychiatric disorders: a retrospective, descriptive study</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="50">2</td>\n<td width="132">Rao <em>et al.</em></td>\n<td valign="top" width="301"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/8/e007525.full?sid=d1086014-ff69-43ac-8054-e464ca93cff7">Alcohol use, socioeconomic deprivation and ethnicity in older people</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="50">3</td>\n<td width="132">Elwyn <em>et al.</em></td>\n<td valign="top" width="301"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/8/e008566.full?sid=2c7032a4-a96f-4447-b835-6a8e2767fbc9">Patients recording clinical encounters: a path to empowerment?
