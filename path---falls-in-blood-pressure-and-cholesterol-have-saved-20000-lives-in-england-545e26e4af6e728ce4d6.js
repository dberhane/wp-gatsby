These might be attributable to other risk factors for heart disease, such as stress, they suggest.</p>\n<p>They conclude that population-wide approaches, focusing on prevention, such as public health initiatives to curb salt and trans fat levels in processed and take-away foods may have more of an impact than prescribing drugs to individuals.</p>\n<p>“Targeting high-risk individuals with medication appears less effective and may also widen socioeconomic inequalities in [coronary heart disease] mortality,” they write.</p>\n<p>“Any intervention that requires people to mobilise their own resources (material and psychological) will understandably favour those who have greater resources, and thus widen social inequalities,” they add.</p>\n<p>When healthcare budgets are stretched, as now, preventive approaches are a better way to get results, they suggest.<!--TrendMD v2.4.6--></p>\n'},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},pathContext:{id:"c07cb347-8e94-5490-8618-01f1f565384b"}}}});
