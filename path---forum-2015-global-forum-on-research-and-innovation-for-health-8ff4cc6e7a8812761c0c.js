With over 4,000 registered delegates representing over 72 countries, this understanding was key to the programme, which featured not only the conference activities onsite in the Philippines but also an online discussion platform to encourage participation from those who were not able to attend in person.</p>\n<p>A message from Benigno Simeon S. Aquino III, President of the Philippines, was delivered by Mario G. Montejo, Secretary of the Department of Science and Technology, commenting that this type of constant and pro-active vigilance from the global research community is what is needed to improve and secure the wellbeing of people all over the world, especially those in low- and middle-income countries.</p>\n<p><em>BMJ Open</em> is pleased to support this meeting by publishing Forum 2015 abstracts – all of which can be found online at: <a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/Suppl_1.toc">http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/Suppl_1.toc</a>.
