Even after taking account of all nursing staff, this variation only dropped to a threefold difference between those with the highest and lowest nurse headcounts.</p>\n<p>Among patients admitted to medical wards, higher death rates were associated with higher numbers of occupied beds for each registered nurse and for each doctor employed by the trust.</p>\n<p>By contrast, higher numbers of healthcare support workers were associated with higher rates of inpatient death.</p>\n<p>When all staff groups were included in the statistical analysis of all 137 trusts, the associations remained significant only for doctors and healthcare support workers.</p>\n<p>Among the subsidiary group of 31 trusts, death rates were 35.2/1000 medical admissions, out of a total of 1 260, 558, and 8.9/1000 surgical admissions, out of a total of 1 084 429.</p>\n<p>But the death rate was 20% lower in those where each registered nurse cared for an average of six or fewer medical inpatients than in trusts were each registered nurse cared for 10 or more. These associations remained significant after further statistical analysis.</p>\n<p>The results on surgical wards were similar, with higher registered nurse to patient ratios associated with a 17% lower inpatient death rate.</p>\n<p>This is an observational study, so no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect, added to which the findings on nurse to patient ratios are based on only 31 trusts.</p>\n<p>“This [study] does not, in itself, provide a robust basis to identify safe staffing thresholds,” they say. “However, given the overall strength of evidence for an association, it does seem feasible to identify staffing levels where risk to patients is likely to be increased,” they suggest.</p>\n<p>Economic pressures and the ageing profile of the nursing workforce internationally all point to a potential future with fewer registered nurses, they warn. But substituting them for less well trained staff may be unwise, they say.</p>\n<p>“When determining the safety of nurse staffing on hospital wards, the level of registered nurse staffing is crucial, and there is no evidence to suggest that higher levels of healthcare support worker staffing have a role in reducing mortality rates,” they write.</p>\n<p>“Current policies geared towards substituting [these] workers for registered nurses should be reviewed in the light of this evidence,” they conclude.</p>\n<p>A podcast for this manuscript is available to listen to here: h<a href="https://soundcloud.com/bmjpodcasts/bmjopen-podcast-alison-walker-peter-griffiths-30-11-2015-davidd-mixdown/s-7Hqki?in=bmjpodcasts/sets/bmj-open-podcast">ttps://soundcloud.com/bmjpodcasts/bmjopen-podcast-alison-walker-peter-griffiths-30-11-2015-davidd-mixdown/s-7Hqki?in=bmjpodcasts/sets/bmj-open-podcast</a><!--TrendMD v2.4.3--></p>\n'},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},pathContext:{id:"edb21e8c-4bb5-5790-a64c-091e9c914f1a"}}}});
