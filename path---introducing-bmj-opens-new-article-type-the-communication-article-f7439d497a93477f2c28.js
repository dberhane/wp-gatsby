In this blog, we introduce the communication article, highlight our first published example, and tell you how you can submit one of your own. </span></p>\n<h4><span style="font-weight: 400">What is a communication article? </span></h4>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since launching in 2011, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMJ Open </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">has focused on three key article types: research articles, study protocols, and cohort profiles. Recently we have received more submissions and enquiries related to material that is of interest to the journal’s readership and values, but does not fit into our existing framework of article types. We believe that the publication of this material is important as it helps encourage  discussion of how clinical research should best be conducted. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">To help facilitate the discussion, we are delighted to announce the launch of a new article type: The communication article.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The communication article will cover content that does not fit within our existing article types, but is of interest to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMJ Open</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">’s readership. Rather than presenting primary research, it is an opportunity to present ideas, examples, and innovations relating to the conduct of clinical research. As with all content in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMJ Open</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, communication articles will relate to key research issues in clinical medicine, public health, and epidemiology. Examples of topics of relevance to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMJ Open </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">include: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Encouraging patient and public involvement</span></li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Improving research transparency and reproducibility</span></li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Reducing research waste through collaboration</span></li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Improving best practice in publishing and peer review</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All communication articles will undergo external open peer review. As with our other content, the peer reviewer reports and previous versions of the manuscript will be posted alongside the final article. We also encourage readers to participate in the discussion by posting comments on the articles. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you are interested in submitting a communication article to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMJ Open</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, we ask that you send us a presubmission enquiry via our </span><a href="https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/bmjopen"><span style="font-weight: 400">online submission system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. You will be asked to provide a title, an abstract and a cover letter explaining why you think your work is appropriate as a communication article for BMJ Open.</span></p>\n<h4><span style="font-weight: 400">The economic returns to medical research funding</span></h4>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To coincide with the launch of the communication article, </span><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2018-022131"><span style="font-weight: 400">we have published our first example</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Written by </span><a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/policy-institute/people/staff/grant.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Jonathan Grant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><a href="https://euroqol.org/user/martin-buxton/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Martin Buxton</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, the article examines the economic returns to investment in medical research. Grant and Buxton argue for the need of transparency in clinical research so that we can understand where, how, and when we acquire returns from clinical research. With funding under threat, it is crucial that we understand what aspects of research are truly beneficial and what aspects are wasteful. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We are thrilled to have published this important and thoughtful work as our first communication article&#8211;we hope the first of many. </span></p>\n<h4><span style="font-weight: 400">How to submit a communication article</span></h4>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Communication articles will be considered at the discretion of the editorial team at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMJ Open</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> based on the relevance of the topic and the quality of a presubmission enquiry. You can complete your presubmission enquiry via </span><a href="https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com"><span style="font-weight: 400">our submission site</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. If approved, you will be invited to upload a complete manuscript. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As with our other article types, there will be an article publishing charge applied to accepted communication articles. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For guidance on how to prepare your submission, please visit our </span><a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Instructions for Authors. </span></a><!--TrendMD v2.4.6--></p>\n'},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},pathContext:{id:"ccc1e80c-7445-5aeb-8f82-2a2b1a64e018"}}}});
