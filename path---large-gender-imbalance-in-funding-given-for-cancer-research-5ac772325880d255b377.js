We would strongly urge policy-makers, funders and the academic and scientific community to investigate the factors leading to our observed differences and seek to ensure that women are appropriately supported in scientific endeavour.”<!--TrendMD v2.4.6--></p>\n'},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},pathContext:{id:"e5723c19-af3b-56c3-8210-8cecd639b698"}}}});
