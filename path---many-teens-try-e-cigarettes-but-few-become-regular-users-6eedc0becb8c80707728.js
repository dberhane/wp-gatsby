This included 0.3% of those who claimed they had never smoked conventional cigarettes.</p>\n<p>These figures suggest that “e-cigarettes are unlikely to make a major direct contribution to adolescent nicotine addiction at present,” write the researchers, who point out that the World Health Organization has recognised that there is little evidence on whether e-cigarettes may or may not act as a gateway to conventional smoking.</p>\n<p>The odds of regular e-cigarette use were 100 times higher among current weekly smokers than among non-smokers, and 50 times higher among those who had smoked cannabis</p>\n<p>The strong link between current smoking and e-cigarette use suggests that teens are not using these products to help them quit smoking, say the researchers.</p>\n<p>They admit that a lack of consensus about what constitutes ‘use’ of an e-cigarette presents something of a challenge for research in this area, and suggest that further much longer term studies to include the generation of young people who have grown up with e-cigarettes are needed before firmer conclusions can be drawn.<!--TrendMD v2.4.3--></p>\n'},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},pathContext:{id:"0a8fd1c8-379c-5a25-99b3-7274ceb143ce"}}}});
