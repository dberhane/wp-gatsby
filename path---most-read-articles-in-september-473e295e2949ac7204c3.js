This month’s top spot still belongs to<em> Ravnskov et al </em>and their systematic review on the associations between low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and mortality in the elderly.<em> Pound et al </em>come in at number three with a qualitative synthesis of young people&#8217;s views and experiences of school sex and relationship education (SRE). They concluded that SRE should be delivered by experts who maintain clear boundaries with students and taught using a ‘sex-positive’ approach &#8211; one that aims for young people to enjoy their sexuality in a way that is safe, consensual and healthy.<br />\n<em><br />\n</em>Other new entries this month include <em>Caffrey et al,</em> who performed a multimethod, qualitative study investigating how a gender equity programme, Athena SWAN, could be enabled and whether  interactions between the programme and the context it is implemented into might produce unintended consequences.</p>\n<p>At number ten is a multimethod study by <em>Power et al,</em> looking at whether a large-scale two-phase quality improvement programme achieved its aim to improve patient safety using a harm-free care approach.</p>\n<p>See below for a full round up of September’s top 10 most read articles.</p>\n<table border="1" width="483" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td valign="top" width="50">Rank</td>\n<td valign="top" width="132">Author(s)</td>\n<td valign="top" width="301">Title</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="50">1</td>\n<td width="132">Ravnskov <em>et al</em>.</td>\n<td valign="top" width="301"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/6/e010401.full">Lack of an association or an inverse association between low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and mortality in the elderly: a systematic review</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="50">2</td>\n<td width="132"><em>Ferrer et al.</em></td>\n<td valign="top" width="301"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/8/e011362.full">Comparative study analysing women&#8217;s childbirth satisfaction and obstetric outcomes across two different models of maternity care</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="50">3</td>\n<td width="132"><em>Pound et al.</em></td>\n<td valign="top" width="301"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/9/e011329.full">What do young people think about their school-based sex and relationship education?
