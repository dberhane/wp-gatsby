The most commonly reported stressor was mental illness in a close family member.</p>\n<p>During the monitoring period, 425 of the women died (at the average age of 79). Between 1968 and 2006, around one in five (19%, 153) developed dementia, 104 of whom developed Alzheimer’s disease.</p>\n<p>On average, it took 29 years for dementia to develop, with 78 the average age at which the condition was diagnosed.</p>\n<p>The number of stressors reported by the women was associated with longstanding symptoms of distress at all of the time points assessed, irrespective of the year of birth.</p>\n<p>And the number of stressors reported in 1968 was associated with a 21% heightened risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and a 15% heightened risk of developing any type of dementia, the analysis showed.</p>\n<p>The findings held true even after taking account of factors likely to influence the results, including a family history of mental health problems.</p>\n<p>The authors emphasise that further research is needed to confirm the results of their study, and to look at whether stress management and behavioural therapy might help.</p>\n<p>But they suggest that “stress may cause a number of physiological reactions in the central nervous, endocrine, immune and cardiovascular systems,&#8221; and point to other studies showing that stress can cause structural and functional damage to the brain and promote inflammation.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, research has also shown that stress hormones can remain at high levels many years after experiencing a traumatic event.<!--TrendMD v2.4.3--></p>\n'},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},pathContext:{id:"a98cc992-125e-5f24-891b-7d406ec04f66"}}}});
