They also facilitate the acquisition of data for meta analysis (more in-depth comparative reviews).</p>\n<p>Data sharing is widespread in laboratory science, but is a new and more complex issue in medical research, because of the need to protect the privacy of research participants and/or seek their consent before sharing data.<span> </span><!--TrendMD v2.4.3--></p>\n'},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"Gatsby for BMJ blog sites"}}},pathContext:{id:"fdeb8663-efac-58f7-910d-2cb589e22943"}}}});
