It has been customised to <i>BMJ Open</i> guidelines to help authors prepare for submission. Penelope was developed by <a href="http://www.peneloperesearch.com/" target="_blank">Penelope Research</a> in collaboration with the <a href="http://www.equator-network.org/" target="_blank">EQUATOR Network</a>.</p>\n<p>Authors have the ability to access Penelope via a <a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.peneloperesearch.com/" target="_blank">link</a> that we have included on the login page of the <a href="https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/bmjopen" target="_blank"><i>BMJ Open</i> submission system</a>. Authors provide the tool with a Word file and within minutes will receive feedback regarding aspects of a manuscript that require improvement, linking to additional resources when necessary. It is our hope that Penelope makes the submission process easier while also improving the reporting quality of submitted manuscripts.</p>\n<p>Regarding the collaboration, James Harwood, Founder and CEO of Penelope Research, says, &#8220;Our goal at Penelope is to make publishing easier and faster, whilst also improving research integrity.
