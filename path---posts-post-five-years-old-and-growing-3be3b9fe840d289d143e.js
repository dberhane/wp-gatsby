Conceived as a general medical journal to provide authors a fast, transparent route to publication, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMJ Open </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">could have developed in many different ways. Happily it has developed into a journal we’re proud of, and despite its broad scope, it has grown into a journal with a strong identity. Publishing </span><a href="http://blogs.bmj.com/bmjopen/category/launch/"><span style="font-weight: 400">230 articles in our first year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, our growth has been steady and consistent, and we have increased our global presence every year. In 2015 we published over 1,500 articles from 70 countries. We have carved out a niche in </span><a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/352/bmj.i641?etoc="><span style="font-weight: 400">qualitative research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and the publication of </span><a href="http://blogs.bmj.com/bmjopen/2015/09/22/introducing-how-to-write-and-publish-a-study-protocol-using-bmjs-new-elearning-programme-research-to-publication/"><span style="font-weight: 400">study protocols</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and articles </span><a href="http://blogs.bmj.com/bmjopen/2015/05/22/should-we-stop-talking-about-negative-results/"><span style="font-weight: 400">less likely to be accepted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in traditional medical journals. </span></p>\n<p><a href="http://blogs.bmj.com/bmjopen/files/2016/02/Number-of-accepted-papers.png" rel="attachment wp-att-955"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-955" src="http://blogs.bmj.com/bmjopen/files/2016/02/Number-of-accepted-papers-300x181.png" alt="Number of accepted papers" width="300" height="181" srcset="http://blogs.bmj.com/bmjopen/files/2016/02/Number-of-accepted-papers-300x181.png 300w, http://blogs.bmj.com/bmjopen/files/2016/02/Number-of-accepted-papers.png 483w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Importantly, as exemplified in our use of open peer review and the publication of reviewers’ reports, we have embraced the notion that research should be open and transparent. Just as importantly, we have a strong belief in the importance of sound methodology, asking authors to state clearly, up front, the methodological strengths and limitations of their study. We believe objectivity takes precedence over novelty and require our authors to adhere to the standards of reporting promoted by </span><a href="http://www.equator-network.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400">the EQUATOR network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Through these guiding principles, we have become, in only five years, the world’s largest general medical journal. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now seems a good time to reflect upon what we have achieved, and where we would like to go. To celebrate, over the next few days we will be highlighting on our blog articles that have gained significant attention, along with articles that demonstrate our unique approach. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, of course, there is still much work to be done. Looking into the future, we hope to continue down the path we are on, growing and developing, particularly in parts of the world that have historically been underrepresented in the medical literature. Global initiatives, such as </span><a href="http://blogs.bmj.com/bmjopen/2015/11/17/bmj-launches-new-chinese-publishing-portal-qa-with-david-wang-and-huili-chen/"><span style="font-weight: 400">BMJ’s China portal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, will become increasingly important to us. We also hope to continue our efforts to make </span><a href="http://datadryad.org/discover?query=bmj+open&amp;submit=Go"><span style="font-weight: 400">data more available and accessible</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, the importance of which has recently been stressed with the public health emergency surrounding the </span><a href="http://www.bmj.com/freezikaresources"><span style="font-weight: 400">Zika virus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. While we have made strong efforts by fully integrating our system with </span><a href="http://datadryad.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dryad</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, we have only scratched the surface. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most of all we want to thank the authors, reviewers, and readers who have made it all possible. Please join us in celebrating our first five years!</span><!--TrendMD v2.4.3--></p>\n'},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"Gatsby for BMJ blog sites"}}},pathContext:{id:"be08b17e-6863-5d49-bb13-0bcbba379aca"}}}});
