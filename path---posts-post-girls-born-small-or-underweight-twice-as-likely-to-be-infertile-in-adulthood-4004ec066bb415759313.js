One in 20 was obese while almost 2.5% were under weight.</p>\n<p>Women whose infertility was attributable to a female cause tended to be heavier than average; excess weight is a known risk factor for infertility.</p>\n<p>Just under 4% of the women had been born prematurely; a similar proportion were underweight at birth; while just under 6% were unexpectedly small babies.</p>\n<p>Analysis of the data showed that women with fertility problems attributable to a female factor, were almost 2.5 times as likely to have been underweight at birth as those in whom the cause of infertility was attributable to a male factor or unexplained.</p>\n<p>Similarly, these women were almost three times as likely to have been born unexpectedly small as those whose primary cause of infertility was unexplained.</p>\n<p>These findings held true even after influential factors, including previous motherhood and current weight, were taken into account.</p>\n<p>By way of possible explanation, the authors suggest that growth restriction in the womb might affect the developing reproductive organs as previous research has linked fetal growth restriction with reduced ovulation.</p>\n<p>And other research has pointed to the fetal origins of some adult diseases, they add.</p>\n<p>They caution that the sample size was relatively small and carried out in one geographical area in one country so may not be applicable elsewhere. Further research would be needed before definitive conclusions could be drawn, they say.</p>\n<p>But they say that if the associations between low birthweight or small birth size and infertility are confirmed, this may have implications for the prevalence of infertility problems.</p>\n<p>“As medical research and care advances, more infants will be born [with low birthweight or small size] and survive, which in turn might influence future need of infertility treatment,” they conclude.<!--TrendMD v2.4.3--></p>\n'},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"Gatsby for BMJ blog sites"}}},pathContext:{id:"b1b0afcc-934e-5af8-872d-248c0fc53022"}}}});
