First up is a pilot study by Wennberg <em>et al</em> which uses a randomised two-condition crossover trial to compare the acute effects of uninterrupted sitting with sitting interrupted by brief bouts of light-intensity walking on self-reported fatigue, cognition, neuroendocrine biomarkers and cardiometabolic risk markers in overweight and obese adults. Kristensen <em>et al</em>&#8216;s paper on the effect of statins remains popular at number two this month and at number four we have an observational study by Geulayov <em>et al</em> which received a press release &#8211; it examines trends in non-fatal self-harm and its management in England. In at number five this month is a study by Chow <em>et al</em> investigating how institutional mental healthcare has changed in Western Europe since 1990, finding that there are ongoing overall trends of a decrease in the number of psychiatric hospital beds and an increase in the number of places in other institutions, including prisons. Last month&#8217;s most read paper by Gunn <em>et al</em> remains in the top ten, and at number ten we have a new entry by Laver <em>et al</em> with a systematic review of systematic reviews, assessing the effects of interventions to delay functional decline in people with dementia.</p>\n<table border="1" width="483" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td valign="top" width="50">Rank</td>\n<td valign="top" width="132">Author(s)</td>\n<td valign="top" width="301">Title</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="50">1</td>\n<td width="132">Wennberg<em> et al</em>.</td>\n<td valign="top" width="301"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/2/e009630.full">Acute effects of breaking up prolonged sitting on fatigue and cognition: a pilot study</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="50">2</td>\n<td width="132">Kristensen <em>et al</em>.</td>\n<td valign="top" width="301"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/9/e007118.full">The effect of statins on average survival in randomised trials, an analysis of end point postponement</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="50">3</td>\n<td width="132">Teschke <em>et al</em>.</td>\n<td valign="top" width="301"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/11/e008052.full">Bicycling injury hospitalisation rates in Canadian jurisdictions: analyses examining associations with helmet legislation and mode share</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="50">4</td>\n<td width="132">Geulayov<em> et al</em>.</td>\n<td valign="top" width="301"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/4/e010538.full">Epidemiology and trends in non-fatal self-harm in three centres in England, 2000–2012: findings from the Multicentre Study of Self-harm in England</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="50">5</td>\n<td width="132">Chow <em>et al</em>.</td>\n<td valign="top" width="301"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/4/e010188.full">How has the extent of institutional mental healthcare changed in Western Europe?
