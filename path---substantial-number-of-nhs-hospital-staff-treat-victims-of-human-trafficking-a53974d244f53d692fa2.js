In eight trusts, this proportion rose to more than one in 10 of the staff.</p>\n<p>Maternity services staff were the most likely to encounter victims of human trafficking, with one in five (20.4%) saying they had treated such patients.</p>\n<p>But most staff in every specialty represented said they didn’t know what questions to ask to spot potential victims (just under 89%), while more than three quarters (78%) said they didn’t feel sufficiently trained to enable them to help victims adequately.</p>\n<p>Over half said they lacked the confidence to make appropriate referrals, with referrals for men vexing the most staff (71%).</p>\n<p>Most participants (over 95%) had no idea of the scale of human trafficking in the UK, and three out of four (76.5%) didn’t realise that without appropriate safeguards, a call to the police could put patients in even more danger.</p>\n<p>“In particular [staff] lack knowledge about how to ask about experiences of human trafficking, how and when to contact law enforcement agencies, and how to make referrals to local and national support agencies,” write the researchers.</p>\n<p>Three out of four of those surveyed said they would be interested in targeted training around people trafficking, particularly those working in mental health and emergency medicine services.</p>\n<p>The researchers caution that their findings may not be applicable to the entire NHS, but suggest that additional training for NHS staff could improve the wellbeing and safety of such a vulnerable group of people.</p>\n<p>A video abstract for this manuscript is available to view here: <a href="https://youtu.be/wvxW0lhFYtQ">https://youtu.be/wvxW0lhFYtQ</a><!--TrendMD v2.4.3--></p>\n'},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},pathContext:{id:"c5299510-83c8-57cf-ac43-97ab9c4ad5ed"}}}});
