And it was more common among men of white ethnicity.</p>\n<p>Caring responsibilities lowered the probability of being at higher risk among women, but religious belief did not—for either sex.</p>\n<p>Employment status did not seem to be a significant factor, but women who had retired were more likely to be at higher risk.</p>\n<p>When the researchers looked at changes in alcohol consumption between the two waves of the survey, they found that among women, loneliness, younger age, and higher income were all associated with the likelihood of becoming a higher risk drinker by 2010-11. A healthy diet seemed to lessen the risk.</p>\n<p>Among men, these transition patterns were similar, except that caring responsibilities, loneliness, older age and lower income increased the likelihood of no longer drinking at risky levels by wave 2 of the survey.</p>\n<p>“We can sketch—at the risk of much simplification—the problem of harmful drinking among people aged 50 or over in England as a middle class phenomenon: people in better health, higher income, with higher educational attainment and socially more active are more likely to drink at harmful levels,” write the researchers.</p>\n<p>“Our findings suggest that harmful drinking in later life is more prevalent among people who exhibit a lifestyle associated with affluence and with a ‘successful’ ageing process,” they add.</p>\n<p>“Harmful drinking may then be a hidden health and social problem in otherwise successful older people,” they warn, concluding: “Consequently, and based on our results, we recommend the explicit incorporation of alcohol drinking levels and patterns into the successful ageing paradigm.”<!--TrendMD v2.4.3--></p>\n'},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},pathContext:{id:"0fbf1a76-96ac-5d3d-a53e-b6860ad4f3cc"}}}});
