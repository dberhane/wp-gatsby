All that we achieved last year would not have been possible without the help of the many referees who gave thorough and detailed reviews which are essential to our decision making process. The comments and evaluations provided by our reviewers allow us to maintain the quality and scientific validity necessary to the continued success of BMJ Open.</p>\n<p>Since its conception BMJ Open has been tirelessly dedicated to provide a home for all properly conducted medical research from all disciplines and therapeutic areas. Our rigorous and transparent peer review process has been crucial to achieving this aim, because of this, we are pleased to be able to continue to offer the 25% reviewers discount to those who submit manuscripts within 12 months of completing their review and also give CME accreditation for the submission of timely and thorough comments.<br />\nThe BMJ Open team is truly thankful for the continued hard work and support of our peer reviewers and we look forward to the year ahead.<!--TrendMD v2.4.3--></p>\n"},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},pathContext:{id:"12be2875-cc67-5bd6-8ee6-16e51b0f2082"}}}});
