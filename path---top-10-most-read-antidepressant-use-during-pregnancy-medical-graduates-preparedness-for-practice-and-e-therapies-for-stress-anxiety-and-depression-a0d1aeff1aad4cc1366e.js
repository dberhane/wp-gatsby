At number 4 is a cohort study by Anick Bérard and colleagues investigating the association between first-trimester exposure to antidepressants and the risk of major congenital malformations in 18,487 depressed/anxious women from Quebec, Canada. Results indicate that antidepressants increase the risk of a wide range of organ-specific malformations. At number 6 is a systematic review and meta-analysis by Tea Reljic and colleagues suggesting that, in terminally ill patients, active treatment targeted at underlying disease does not have a demonstrable impact on overall survival compared to palliative care.</p>\n<p>Also making its way into the top ten is a rapid review of the literature examining the preparedness of UK graduates for practice as junior doctors. Whilst the review indicates that junior doctors are well prepared in a number of different areas of practice, some problem areas are identified including safe and legal prescribing, multidisciplinary team-working, handovers, breaking bad news to patients, learning needs and reflective practice.</p>\n<p>Other new entries this month include a systematic review of life expectancy among individuals with non-cancer chronic disease and a survey of web and smartphone apps used and recommended for stress, anxiety or depression by the National Health Service in England. Fenton et al.’s systematic review of dietary acid load, alkaline water and cancer moves up four positions to become January’s most read article.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width="45"><strong>Rank</strong></td>\n<td width="170"><strong>Author(s)</strong></td>\n<td width="401"><strong>Title</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="45">1</td>\n<td width="170"><em>Fenton et al.</em></td>\n<td width="401"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/6/e010438.full">Systematic review of the association between dietary acid load, alkaline water and cancer</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="45">2</td>\n<td width="170"><em>Ravnskov et al.</em></td>\n<td width="401"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/6/e010401.full">Lack of an association or an inverse association between low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and mortality in the elderly: a systematic review</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="45">3</td>\n<td width="170"><em>Boulton et al. </em></td>\n<td width="401"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/3/e010330">How much sugar is hidden in drinks marketed to children?
