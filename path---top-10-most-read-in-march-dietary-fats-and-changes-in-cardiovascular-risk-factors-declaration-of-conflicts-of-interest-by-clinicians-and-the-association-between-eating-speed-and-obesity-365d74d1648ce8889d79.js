In the top spot, and receiving quite a bit of attention on social media, is a randomised trial by Khaw <em>et al</em> looking at coconut oil, olive oil and butter as dietary fats and the changes in blood lipid profile, weight, fat distribution and metabolic markers after four weeks consumption in healthy men and women in the general population. Their findings, while not changing current dietary recommendations, highlight the need for further elucidation of the more nuanced relationships between different dietary fats and health.</p>\n<p><img class="alignleft" title="Image: Coconut_and_oil.jpg, by Phu Thinh Co" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Coconut_and_oil.jpg/552px-Coconut_and_oil.jpg" alt="File:Coconut and oil.jpg" width="274" height="286" />At number two, a secondary analysis of health check-up data examines the relationships between eating speed and obesity in patients with diabetes. Feldman <em>et al</em>, reaching number three this month, conduct a cross-sectional study investigating the declaration of conflicts of interest by clinicians to NHS employers. Finding that recording of employees’ conflicts of interest by NHS trusts is poor, the authors recommend a national template for reporting conflicts of interest modelled on the US ‘Sunshine Act’.</p>\n<p>Sartorius <em>et al</em> present a systematic review and meta-analysis testing the assocation between high carbohydrate intake and obesity at number six, while at number eight van Der Werf <em>et al</em> find that GPs additionally trained in integrative or complementary medicine have lower antibiotic prescribing rates than those that do not. Finally, at number ten, Mortensen <em>et al</em> study the impact of a midwife-led continuity model to improve maternal services in a low-resource setting.</p>\n<table border="1" width="483" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td valign="top" width="50">Rank</td>\n<td valign="top" width="132">Author(s)</td>\n<td valign="top" width="301">Title</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="50">1</td>\n<td width="132">Khaw <em>et al</em>.</td>\n<td valign="top" width="301"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/3/e020167">Randomised trial of coconut oil, olive oil or butter on blood lipids and other cardiovascular risk factors in healthy men and women</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="50">2</td>\n<td width="132">Hurst<em> et al</em>.</td>\n<td valign="top" width="301"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/1/e019589">Effects of changes in eating speed on obesity in patients with diabetes: a secondary analysis of longitudinal health check-up data</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="50">3</td>\n<td width="132">Feldman<em> et al</em><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/10/e017902">.</a></td>\n<td valign="top" width="301">\n<div class="highwire-cite-title"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/3/e019952"> A cross-sectional study of all clinicians conflict of interest disclosures to NHS hospital employers in England 2015-2016</a></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="50">4</td>\n<td width="132">Xie <em>et al</em>.</td>\n<td valign="top" width="301"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/6/e015735"> Risk of death among users of Proton Pump Inhibitors: a longitudinal observational cohort study of United States veterans</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="50">5</td>\n<td width="132">Anker <em>et al</em><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/6/e015087">.</a></td>\n<td valign="top" width="301"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/3/e019700">Comorbid psychiatric disorders in a clinical sample of adults with ADHD, and associations with education, work and social characteristics: a cross-sectional study</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="50">6</td>\n<td width="132">Sartorius <em>et al</em>.</td>\n<td valign="top" width="301"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/2/e018449">Does high-carbohydrate intake lead to increased risk of obesity?
