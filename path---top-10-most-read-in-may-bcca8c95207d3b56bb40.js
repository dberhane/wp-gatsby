This month,<em> Petrilli et al</em> are at first place with an observational study examining patient preferences for physician attire. While formal attire with a white coat was found to be the most highly rated, the authors conclude that patient expectations and perceptions for physician attire varied significantly by clinical context and region.</p>\n<p>Also new this month is a systematic review by <em>Gimson et al</em>, which investigates the ass<span style="font-size: 1rem">ociation between clinically significa</span><span style="font-size: 1rem">nt midlife anxiety and late-life dementia. The authors found that clinically significant midlife anxiety was associated with an increased risk of dementia after an interval of 10 years. However, <em>Gimson et al</em> caution that further research is needed to confirm the role of anxiety as a risk factor for dementia and clarify the underlying mechanisms.</span></p>\n<p>Other new entries include a systematic analysis of UK cancer research funding awarded by gender of primary investigator (PI)<em>.</em> <em>Zhou et al</em> demonstrate significant gender differences in cancer research investment, with female PIs receiving less funding than male PIs. The authors suggest that further work is required to determine the factors involved in the observed gender differences.</p>\n<p>Lastly, in at number nine is <em>Heneghan et al</em>, who examine the effect of sedentary behaviour and physical activity on thoracic spinal mobility. The authors found reduced thoracic mobility in individuals who spend over 7 hours per day sitting and less than 150 min per week being physically active. <em>Heneghan et al</em> highlight that additional studies including individuals from different age groups and sociodemographic backgrounds are required to ensure generalisability to different populations.</p>\n<table style="height: 946px" width="744">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width="45"><strong>Rank</strong></td>\n<td width="170"><strong>Author(s)</strong></td>\n<td width="401"><strong>Title</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="45">1</td>\n<td width="170"><em>Petrilli et al.</em></td>\n<td width="401"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/5/e021239">Understanding patient preference for physician attire: a cross-sectional observational study of 10 academic medical centres in the USA</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="45">2</td>\n<td width="170"><em>Gimson et al. </em></td>\n<td width="401"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/4/e019399">Support for midlife anxiety diagnosis as an independent risk factor for dementia: a systematic review</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="45">3</td>\n<td width="170"><em>Papadopoulou et al. </em></td>\n<td width="401"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/3/e018895">Maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy and childhood growth and overweight: results from a large Norwegian prospective observational cohort study</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="45">4</td>\n<td width="170"><em>Chiavaroli et al.</em></td>\n<td width="401"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/3/e019438">Effect of pasta in the context of low-glycaemic index dietary patterns on body weight and markers of adiposity: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials in adults</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="45">5</td>\n<td width="170"><em>Xie et al. </em></td>\n<td width="401"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/6/e015735">Risk of death among users of Proton Pump Inhibitors: a longitudinal observational cohort study of United States veterans</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="45">6</td>\n<td width="170"><em>Hurst et al. </em></td>\n<td width="401"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/1/e019589">Effects of changes in eating speed on obesity in patients with diabetes: a secondary analysis of longitudinal health check-up data</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="45">7</td>\n<td width="170"><em>Zhou et al. </em></td>\n<td width="401"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/4/e018625">A systematic analysis of UK cancer research funding by gender of primary investigator</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="45">8</td>\n<td width="170"><em>Ashton et al. </em></td>\n<td width="401"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/10/e016089">Do emotions related to alcohol consumption differ by alcohol type?
