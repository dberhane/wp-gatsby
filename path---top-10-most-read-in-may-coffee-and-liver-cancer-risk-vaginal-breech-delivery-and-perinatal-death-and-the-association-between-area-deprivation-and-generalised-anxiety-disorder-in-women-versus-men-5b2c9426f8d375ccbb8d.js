Knocking Ravnskov et al.’s study off the top spot is a systematic review and meta-analysis of coffee and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by Oliver Kennedy and colleagues. Their study suggests that increasing coffee consumption by two cups per day is associated with a 35% reduction in the risk of HCC. At number 3 is a national cohort study of over 520,000 term-born singletons by researchers from Norway who have found that vaginal breech delivery is associated with an excess risk for neonatal mortality compared with vaginal cephalic delivery, but not with an excess risk for cerebral palsy. Other new entries include a large population study of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) in the UK by researchers from the University of Cambridge, who have found that area deprivation is significantly associated with an increased risk for GAD in women, but not in men.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width="45"><strong>Rank</strong></td>\n<td width="170"><strong>Author(s)</strong></td>\n<td width="401"><strong>Title</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="45">1</td>\n<td width="170"><em>Kennedy et al.</em></td>\n<td width="401"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/5/e013739">Coffee, including caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee, and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="45">2</td>\n<td width="170"><em>Ravnskov et al.</em></td>\n<td width="401"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/6/e010401">Lack of an association or an inverse association between low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and mortality in the elderly: a systematic review</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="45">3</td>\n<td width="170"><em>Bjellmo et al. </em></td>\n<td width="401"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/4/e014979">Is vaginal breech delivery associated with higher risk for perinatal death and cerebral palsy compared with vaginal cephalic birth?
