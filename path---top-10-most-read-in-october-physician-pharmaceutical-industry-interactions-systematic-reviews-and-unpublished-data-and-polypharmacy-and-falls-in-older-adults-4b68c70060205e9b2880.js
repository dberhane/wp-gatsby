Climbing back into the top position is a longitudinal cohort study by Xie <em>et al.</em>, which examines the association between Proton Pump Inhibitors and the risk of all-cause mortality.</p>\n<p><a href="http://blogs.bmj.com/bmjopen/files/2017/11/headache-1540220_1920.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1193 size-medium alignright" title="Public domain" src="http://blogs.bmj.com/bmjopen/files/2017/11/headache-1540220_1920-300x200.jpg" alt="Public domain" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://blogs.bmj.com/bmjopen/files/2017/11/headache-1540220_1920-300x200.jpg 300w, http://blogs.bmj.com/bmjopen/files/2017/11/headache-1540220_1920-768x512.jpg 768w, http://blogs.bmj.com/bmjopen/files/2017/11/headache-1540220_1920-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><br />\nNew in at number five is a systematic review by Fickweiler <em>et al.</em>, exploring whether physicians’ interactions with pharmaceutical industry representatives impact on their attitude and prescribing habits. The researchers extracted and synthesised data from studies encompassing an assortment of study designs; they demonstrate that interactions with pharmaceutical industry representatives affect physicians’ prescribing behaviour and may compromise their objectivity.</p>\n<p>At number six is a new entry by Ziai <em>et al.</em> The researchers audited a selection of systematic reviews published in 2013 and examined the proportion that included unpublished data in the analysis and assessed for publication bias. The results demonstrate that 36% of systematic reviews did not search for unpublished data and that publication bias was present in 40% of the published systematic reviews that assessed for it.</p>\n<p>Dhalwani <em>et al.</em> are new in at number eight. Using data from The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing the researchers examine the association between polypharmacy and falls in older adults. The rate of falls was found to be 21% higher in people with polypharmacy (five or more drugs) than those without. The final new entry for October is at number 9; Firmino-Machado <em>et al.</em> report the protocol for an ongoing population-based randomised controlled trial to improve Cervical Cancer Screening Adherence.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width="45"><strong>Rank</strong></td>\n<td width="166"><strong>Author(s)</strong></td>\n<td width="389"><strong>Title</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="45">1</td>\n<td width="166"><em>Xie et al. </em></td>\n<td width="389"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/6/e015735">Risk of death among users of Proton Pump Inhibitors: a longitudinal observational cohort study of United States veterans</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="45">2</td>\n<td width="166"><em>Graham et al.</em></td>\n<td width="389"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/9/e016942">What factors are associated with reporting lacking interest in sex and how do these vary by gender?
