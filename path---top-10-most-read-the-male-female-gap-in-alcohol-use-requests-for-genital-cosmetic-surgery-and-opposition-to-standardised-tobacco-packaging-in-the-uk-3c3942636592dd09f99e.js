In at number 2 is a systematic review investigating birth cohort changes in male-to-female ratios in indicators of alcohol use and related harms. The authors concluded that the male–female gap in alcohol use was closing over time, with women now drinking almost as much as men. At number 3 is a survey of GPs’ knowledge, attitudes and practice regarding female genital cosmetic surgery in Australia. The study found high rates of women contacting their GP about genital normality concerns, with those requesting female genital cosmetic surgery frequently having a suspected or diagnosed psychological problem.</p>\n<p>Other new entries include a documentary analysis of opponents to standardised packaging in the UK by <a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/health/staff/jenny-hatchard/">Dr Jenny Hatchard</a> and colleagues from the University of Bath and Aston University. The authors found that opposition to standardised packaging was primarily undertaken by third parties with financial relationships to major tobacco manufacturers, whilst a lack of transparency regarding these links created a misleading impression of diverse and widespread opposition.</p>\n<p>Ravnskov et al.’s systematic review on the associations between low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and mortality remains in first place for a fifth month in a row.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width="45"><strong>Rank</strong></td>\n<td width="170"><strong>Author(s)</strong></td>\n<td width="401"><strong>Title</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="45">1</td>\n<td width="170"><em>Ravnskov et al.</em></td>\n<td width="401"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/6/e010401.full">Lack of an association or an inverse association between low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and mortality in the elderly: a systematic review</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="45">2</td>\n<td width="170"><em>Slade et al. </em></td>\n<td width="401"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/10/e011827.full">Birth cohort trends in the global epidemiology of alcohol use and alcohol-related harms in men and women: systematic review and metaregression</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="45">3</td>\n<td width="170"><em>Simonis et al. </em></td>\n<td width="401"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/9/e013010.full">Female genital cosmetic surgery: a cross-sectional survey exploring knowledge, attitude and practice of general practitioners</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="45">4</td>\n<td width="170"><em>Fenton et al.</em></td>\n<td width="401"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/6/e010438.full">Systematic review of the association between dietary acid load, alkaline water and cancer</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="45">5</td>\n<td width="170"><em>Power et al. </em></td>\n<td width="401"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/9/e011886.full">Multimethod study of a large-scale programme to improve patient safety using a harm-free care approach</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="45">6</td>\n<td width="170"><em>Nazar et al. </em></td>\n<td width="401"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/10/e012532.full">New transfer of care initiative of electronic referral from hospital to community pharmacy in England: a formative service evaluation</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="45">7</td>\n<td width="170"><em>Hatchard et al. </em></td>\n<td width="401"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/10/e012634.full">Standardised tobacco packaging: a health policy case study of corporate conflict expansion and adaptation</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="45">8</td>\n<td width="170"><em>Pound et al. </em></td>\n<td width="401"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/9/e011329.full">What do young people think about their school-based sex and relationship education?
