At number one, Pereira Gray <em>et al</em> examine continuity of doctor care and whether this is related to mortality while at number two, Petrilli <em>et al</em> take a look at patient preference for physician attire.</p>\n<p>A case-control study from Heazell <em>et al</em> enters the list this month at number three, reporting on the perception of fetal movements in women who experienced a stillbirth. Having collected data from 41 maternity units in the UK, the authors concluded that an increased strength of fetal movements and fetal hiccups is associated with decreased risk of stillbirth. Wade <em>et al</em>, at number four, perform a mixed-methods intervention development study to test the feasibility of a psychological intervention for patients in intensive care, to reduce acute stress and prevent future morbidity.</p>\n<p>In at number five, a cross-sectional study from Marzouk et al takes a look at anxiety and depressive symptoms among Tunisian medical residents. They conclude that Tunisian residents experience a rate of anxiety/depression which is substantially higher than that reported at the international level, and call for future interventions to address this. Finally, new to the list this month and entering at number nine, a paper by Fancourt et al explores whether listening to music during pregnancy is associated with lower symptoms of postnatal depression and higher well-being in mothers post-birth.</p>\n<table border="1" width="483" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td valign="top" width="50">Rank</td>\n<td valign="top" width="132">Author(s)</td>\n<td valign="top" width="301">Title</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="50">1</td>\n<td width="132">Pereira Gray<em> et al</em>.</td>\n<td valign="top" width="301"><a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/6/e021161">Continuity of care with doctors&#8211;a matter of life and death?
