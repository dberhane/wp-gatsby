And the combined costs of health and social care for dementia came to £11.6 billion in 2012, the researchers calculated.</p>\n<p>This was more than double the equivalent costs for cancer at £5 billion, and significantly more than for stroke (£2.9 billion) and coronary heart disease (£2.5 billion).</p>\n<p>This means that for every £10 of health and social care costs attributable to each condition, £1.08 in research funding was spent on cancer, £0.65 on coronary heart disease, £0.19 on stroke, and just £0.08 on dementia, the researchers calculated.</p>\n<p>Since 2010, there have been substantial changes in medical research funding policies, particularly by government organisations, which pumped 21% of the total share into dementia research and 12% into stroke research in 2012, with cancer attracting 46% of the total spend.</p>\n<p>The equivalent figures in 2008 were 66% for cancer, 21% for coronary heart disease, 9% for dementia, and just 4% for stroke.</p>\n<p>But the sums allocated by charities have scarcely budged since 2008, say the researchers. Charities are reliant on public funds so this stasis may be down to public perception of risk or a form of ageism, derived from the belief that stroke and dementia are inevitable only in the elderly, they suggest.</p>\n<p>Despite the shift in funding priorities, research into the treatment and prevention of dementia and stroke remains underfunded when compared with the economic and personal impact these conditions have, they conclude.<!--TrendMD v2.4.6--></p>\n'},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},pathContext:{id:"9f134b63-7cac-5b13-b8b6-e15ec07cb6b0"}}}});
