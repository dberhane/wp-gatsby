Its creation was funded by four Canadian health research institutions. </span></span></p>\n<p><span style="font-family: Calibri">The <a href="http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1556168" target="_blank">full statement </a>has been published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, and the <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.e7586?" target="_blank">explanation and elaboration</a> in the BMJ. BMJ Open’s editor-in-chief, Dr Trish Groves, is a member of the SPIRIT group. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-family: Calibri">BMJ Open published 17 protocols in 2011 and 79 in 2012, though not all were for interventional trials. We require ethics approval and registration in an ICMJE-approved registry for trial protocols, and encourage registration of systematic review protocols in <a href="http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/" target="_blank">PROSPERO</a>, led by BMJ Open editorial board member Prof Lesley Stewart.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-family: Calibri">Publishing protocols provides a valuable service by allowing researchers to publicise ongoing work and hopefully facilitating cooperation and reducing duplicated efforts. By making the intended methods fully available the chances of a study’s replication may be enhanced. Protocol publication should also ensure that any changes to methods adopted during a trial are reported as such in results papers. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-family: Calibri">As the SPIRIT authors <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.e7586?" target="_blank">write</a>, &#8216;High quality protocols facilitate proper conduct, reporting, and external review of clinical trials.&#8217; We will be encouraging authors to use SPIRIT to help meet these goals. </span><!--TrendMD v2.4.3--></p>\n'},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},pathContext:{id:"8043666f-0fcf-54b3-9e78-8eb8fe041d9e"}}}});
