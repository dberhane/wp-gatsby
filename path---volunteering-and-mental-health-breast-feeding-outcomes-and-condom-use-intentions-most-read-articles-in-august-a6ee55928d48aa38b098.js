Returning to the top spot this month is a systematic review on the lack of an association or an inverse association between low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and mortality in the elderly, by Ravnskov <em>et al</em>. At numbers three and six respectively, we have Quigley <em>et al</em> with a cross-sectional study examining the association between breast feeding outcomes and place of birth, and Tabassum et al with a study on the association of volunteering with mental well-being which also received a <a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/suppl/2016/08/04/bmjopen-2016-011327.DC1/bmjopen-2016-011327_Press_release.pdf">press release</a>. Levett <em>et al</em> come in at number eight with randomised controlled trial which concludes that an antenatal integrative medicine education programme in addition to usual care significantly reduced epidural use and caesarean section in nulliparous women. Finally, at number ten is an experimental study by Eleftheriou <em>et al</em> looking at the influence of attractiveness on the condom use intentions of heterosexual men.</p>\n<table border="1" width="483" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td valign="top" width="50">Rank</td>\n<td valign="top" width="132">Author(s)</td>\n<td valign="top" width="301">Title</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="50">1</td>\n<td width="132">Ravnskov <em>et al</em>.</td>\n<td valign="top" width="301"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/6/e010401.full">Lack of an association or an inverse association between low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and mortality in the elderly: a systematic review</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="50">2</td>\n<td width="132">Kristensen <em>et al</em>.</td>\n<td valign="top" width="301"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/9/e007118.full">The effect of statins on average survival in randomised trials, an analysis of end point postponement</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="50">3</td>\n<td width="132">Quigley <em>et al</em>.</td>\n<td valign="top" width="301"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/8/e010551.full">Association between home birth and breast feeding outcomes: a cross-sectional study in 28 125 mother-infant pairs from Ireland and the UK</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="50">4</td>\n<td width="132">Teschke <em>et al</em>.</td>\n<td valign="top" width="301"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/11/e008052.full">Bicycling injury hospitalisation rates in Canadian jurisdictions: analyses examining associations with helmet legislation and mode share</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="50">5</td>\n<td width="132">Hill <em>et al</em>.</td>\n<td valign="top" width="301"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/8/e012331.full">Development and initial cohort validation of the Arthritis Research UK Musculoskeletal Health Questionnaire (MSK-HQ) for use across musculoskeletal care pathways</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="50">6</td>\n<td width="132">Tabassum <em>et al</em>.</td>\n<td valign="top" width="301"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/8/e011327.full">Association of volunteering with mental well-being: a lifecourse analysis of a national population-based longitudinal study in the UK</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="50">7</td>\n<td width="132">Smyth et<em> al</em>.</td>\n<td valign="top" width="301"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/8/e011218.full">Identification of adults with sepsis in the prehospital environment: a systematic review</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="50">8</td>\n<td width="132">Levett<em> et al</em>.</td>\n<td valign="top" width="301"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/7/e010691.full">Complementary therapies for labour and birth study: a randomised controlled trial of antenatal integrative medicine for pain management in labour</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="50">9</td>\n<td width="132">Jaber<em> et al</em>.</td>\n<td valign="top" width="301"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/8/e011298.full">New method of preoxygenation for orotracheal intubation in patients with hypoxaemic acute respiratory failure in the intensive care unit, non-invasive ventilation combined with apnoeic oxygenation by high flow nasal oxygen: the randomised OPTINIV study protoco</a>l</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="50">10</td>\n<td width="132">Eleftheriou <em>et al.</em></td>\n<td valign="top" width="301"><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/6/e010883.full">Does attractiveness influence condom use intentions in heterosexual men?
