And one in three (34%) felt they were not achieving a great deal.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-size: x-small;font-family: sans-serif">A high score for one of the components was linked to high scores in the other two.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-size: x-small;font-family: sans-serif">Male doctors were significantly more likely to be depersonalised than women doctors, as were those who had been qualified under 20 years ago compared with those who had been qualified for longer.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-size: x-small;font-family: sans-serif">The authors suggest that the gender differences may be explained by a larger number of women doctors working part time or that women doctors are more patient centred than their male colleagues, which may boost professional satisfaction.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-size: x-small;font-family: sans-serif">Depersonalised doctors were significantly more likely to work in group practices, rather than as single-handers, a finding the authors describe as “disappointing,” given that, in theory, group practice should offer more support.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-size: x-small;font-family: sans-serif">“The finding could be the result of group practice creating extra demands on practitioners while raising the possibility of interpersonal tensions and conflicts,” suggest the authors: “Regardless of cause, these findings are worrying as group practices are increasing in size and number,” they add.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-size: x-small;font-family: sans-serif">Depersonalised doctors were also significantly more likely to repeatedly see the same patients.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-size: x-small;font-family: sans-serif">Burnout, however, did not seem to interfere with doctors’ professionalism. The results of a validated rating survey (DISQ) of 38 doctors, involving almost 1900 patients and 760 consultations, indicated no detrimental impact on their interpersonal skills or patient centredness.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-size: x-small;font-family: sans-serif">The authors emphasise that their findings relate to doctors in one area of England, so may not be applicable across the UK, but confirm that this is the largest number of GPs ever to complete an MBI.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-size: x-small;font-family: sans-serif">“Whatever the reasons [for depersonalisation], a significant group of doctors is in trouble,” conclude the authors, citing previous research indicating that GPs who distance themselves as a coping mechanism, evoke, over time, more demanding patients.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-size: x-small;font-family: sans-serif">The results warrant attention from doctors themselves, their professional bodies, and the NHS, say the authors, warning: “The NHS nationally and locally needs to review its policies, especially when generating increased pressures for this, the largest group of NHS doctors.” </span><!--TrendMD v2.4.3--></p>\n'},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},pathContext:{id:"f7c7a29d-ff06-5a31-aa94-432a49701d6f"}}}});
