Celebrated around the world on or near May 20, Clinical Trials Day commemorates the date when, in 1747, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Lind">James Lind</a> started the first clinical trial to test citrus fruits as a treatment for scurvy.</p>\n<p class="text-align-center">This year&#8217;s campaign from the NIHR is <a href="http://www.nihr.ac.uk/get-involved/ok-to-ask.htm">OK To Ask</a>, which encourages patients and carers to inquire about research opportunities that could be available. We here at BMJ Open support initiatives for <a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/1/e010063.full">patient involvement in research and decision-making</a> and hope that, in making our content freely available online, we help make research more familiar and accessible to the public, including patients, for whom the research is ultimately intended.</p>\n<p class="text-align-center">While James Lind&#8217;s basic principle for the trial remains, the scale, sophistication, and problems surrounding modern trials are evolving rapidly. The importance of <a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/11/e009758.full?utm_source=Marketing_Email&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_campaign=20052016_ICTD_bmjopen&amp;utm_content=article+1+&amp;utm_term=">registering drugs</a> and <a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/4/e010535.full?utm_source=Marketing_Email&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_campaign=20052016_ICTD_bmjopen&amp;utm_content=article+2&amp;utm_term=">publishing all trial results </a>is recognised, but adherence remains unsatisfactory. The notion of what constitutes an intervention is also changing, with <a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/2/e010069.full?utm_source=Marketing_Email&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_campaign=20052016_ICTD_bmjopen&amp;utm_content=article+3&amp;utm_term=">text messaging</a> and <a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/1/e009318.full?utm_source=Marketing_Email&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_campaign=20052016_ICTD_bmjopen&amp;utm_content=article+4&amp;utm_term=">educational methods</a> now being studied using the same framework as drugs.</p>\n<p class="text-align-center">BMJ Open will continue efforts to improve the quality of reporting trials, emphasizing the importance of <a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/4/8/e004831.abstract">publishing null and negative results</a> and <a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml#studyprotocols">study protocols</a>. The clinical trial is certainly worthy of celebration, along with improvement.</p>\n<p><!--TrendMD v2.4.3--></p>\n'},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},pathContext:{id:"f09c9288-69d3-5183-a285-6d6f168ecf3d"}}}});
